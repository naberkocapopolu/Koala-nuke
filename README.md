# KOALA NUKER
- This is probably one of the most demanded and awaited script my community has ever asked for. After getting a 60$ bid, I decided to upload it open source and free because im a good guy :) (and also because i dont care about the community anymore)

# INSTALLATION
- Just run the main.py, there is nothing to install or anything. Its a simple requests + threading nuker

- Known issue: breaks when running on any python version below 3.11.6, this is due to the nuker depending on the following patches in 3.11.6
